                    There are many restaurants. Some restaurants are quick and easy and others you stay at for a couple
                    of hours. Some are very expensive but others are affordable. Not all restaurants have waiters or
                    waitresses. Some of them have drive-thrus and others do not. There are three main categories: fast
                    food restaurants, sit-down chain restaurants, and Five Star restaurants.
                    One category of restaurants is fast food. Most of these restaurants have a drive-thru. Not everyone
                    eats inside the restaurant. Some people take it home or even eat it inside their car. When a person
                    orders their food, they can either drive through the drive-thru or go inside to order. A person's
                    order can sometimes take longer if the person goes inside to order rather than
                    going through the drive-thru. A person can get their order the fastest by going to a fast food
                    restaurant. Most fast food restaurants sell a lot of fried and greasy foods, but there are some that
                    also serve healthy foods. There are no waiters or waitresses; there is only the person behind the
                    counter who takes the orders and the person who occasionally wipes down the tables.
                    Burger King, McDonalds, and Popeye's are three examples of fast food restaurants.Another category of
                    restaurants is sit-down chain restaurants. When a group of people walk in the door of one of these
                    restaurants, there will normally be a hostess standing behind a podium waiting to seat them. Then
                    after they have looked at their menu a waiter or waitress will take their order. These restaurants
                    serve all kinds of food, including foods that fast food restaurants would serve. The service in
                    these restaurants is a lot slower than fast food restaurants. Most sit-down chain restaurants have
                    some sort of theme in them. Like a Mexican theme, Wild West theme, or an Australia theme. Some
                    examples of chain restaurants are Outback Steakhouse, Apple Bees, and Red Lobster.
